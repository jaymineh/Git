# Project 10 - Load Balancer Solution With NGINX & SSL/TLS

In this project, I implemented an NGINX load balancer solution to distribute traffic evenly among the web servers from Project 7. This solution is a step up from the previous as a domain name was added so the resources can be reached over the internet. Security measures were also taken by implementing secure HTTPS connection with periodically updated SSL/TLS certificates.
