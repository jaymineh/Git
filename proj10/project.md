# Project 10 - Load Balancer Solution With NGINX & SSL/TLS

**Step 1 - Configure NGINX As A Load Balancer**
---

- Spin up a new Ubuntu server for the NGINX load balancer. Open up ports 80 and 443 for HTTP & HTTPS traffic.

- Update and upgrade the server.

- Update the `/etc/hosts` file for local DNS with Web Serversâ€™ names (e.g. Web1, Web2 & Web3) and their local IP addresses.

- Install nginx by running `sudo apt install nginx`.

**Step 2 - Configure Local DNS On NGINX**
---

- Run `sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to open the nginx config file to configure the LB using the web server names defined in `/etc/hosts`. See config below:
```
upstream myproject {
    server Web1 weight=5;
    server Web2 weight=5;
    server Web3 weight=5;
  }

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.domain.com;
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://myproject;
    }
  }
```
*Note that the above config must be placed in the **http** section*

- Comment out this line `include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;`

- Save the config file and restart nginx. After restarting, check the status of nginx to confirm it is working.

**Step 3 - Register New Domain Name**
---

*Before we register a new domain name, we need to assign a static public IP to our load balancer as that is what will be used to link the domain name so it can be reahed over the internet.*

- Acquire and assign an elastic IP to the load balancer. Since we will be calling the load balancer from the internet, the IP has to be assigned to it and NOT any other machine.

- Go to `http://freenoms.com` and create a free domain name and link it with the elastic IP from AWS. After this, test by putting the domain name in your browser to see if it resolves to the load balancer webpage.

- Update the nginx config file so it recognizes the new domain name by changing the `server_name` field to the newly acquired domain name.
